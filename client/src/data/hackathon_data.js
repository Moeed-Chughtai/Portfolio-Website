            During GreatUniHack, my team utilized Capitol One API for a finance management web app, beneficial for students. 
            Features included spending trend visualization, maps, and a data analysis algorithm offering personalised money management advice. 
            The hackathon provided valuable collaborative problem-solving experience under time constraints, culminating in a presentation to judges.
