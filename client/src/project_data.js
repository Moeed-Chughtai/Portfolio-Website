            In response to the performance issues caused by unnecessary features and intrusive ads in modern chat apps, I developed a streamlined chat solution that prioritises performance without sacrificing essential features, using Android Studio. 
            With over 5000 lines of code, written in Java for functionality and XML for interface design, the app seamlessly handles text, image, and video messaging in both direct messages and group chats. Users can also edit and delete messages, ensuring a smooth communication experience. 
            To enhance security and scalability, I integrated Firebase for two-factor authentication and message storage. This allowed me to delve into NoSQL database structures and gain valuable experience in full-stack application development. 
            In demonstrating my commitment to data security, I implemented asymmetric encryption using the RSA algorithm. This ensures that user data remains protected during transmission, building trust and reliability within the application.
